# DatCon
http://www.datfile.net/DatCon/downloads.html

you can run this by doing `java -jar DatCon.jar <InputFile.DAT> <OutputFile.csv>`
You need to include .DAT and .CSV
This will extract some of the most crucial information, to change what info it extracts, you can go into [Record.java](DatCon/src/DatConRecs/Record.java) and change the returnMe String[] to include or exclude specific headers

If you have any questions feel free to post a PR or Issue!  Happy Flying!
